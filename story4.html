<b>Section 0.1 - Unshrouding Our World of Territories</b>
<br>
<br>
	Around the world, we are constantly tangled in, grappling with, and asserting ourselves onto flows of concrete realities. This can be considered the basis of our reality, inasmuch as we can define the real through sight, touch, sound, and other senses. Our basic construction of the real is based on a series of flows (economic, cultural, social, and political) that pass through, surround us, and are constantly both outside and inside us. This conception of society, the social, the real, is a series of territories. These territories are generally defined in an ad hoc or post hoc fashion. The ad hoc application typically arises as an expansion of the existing World View, defining and/or refining the new or general creation by/for/of power in response to the needs of either the government, corporations, or the general population. Here, when we speak of power, our aim is not to single out physical, social, political, or economic flows of power as standalone extensions or expressions of power. Instead, we speak abstractly about the nuance that defines/refines the entangled flows of all these different expressions of power that coincide with one another.
    <br>
    <br>
Uncommonly, where the ad hoc application of territories does not exist, there is what we can consider an Undefined-Territory. These undefined territories are far and few between, and oftentimes, they remain outside the realm of Territorialization. However, when they can no longer remain outside the grasp of Territorialization, the agents of capital or government quickly fill this power vacuum, and thus, the post hoc application of Territory can be found here. These undefined territories that elude Territorialization and definition hold an implicit value to the ruling/capital class. Post hoc rationalization differs from ad hoc rationalization as it is expressed as a series of demands and wants that are defined through the direct application of "pure" economic and political power without any recognition of the potentiality of social or cultural flows. Therefore, the most significant difference between ad hoc and post hoc Territorialization is the exclusion of social and cultural flows of power in the realization of post hoc Territories; ad hoc Territorialization relies on the interaction between the economic, political, social, and cultural flows of power to define/refine new or existing Territories.
<br>
<br>
<b>Section 0.2 - A Broad Definition of Territories</b>
<br>
<br>
To begin this examination and definition of (De/Re)Territorialization, we must first outline what a territory is or can be. Territories can be defined as the delineated area, idea, concept, shape, feeling, etc., that arises as the result of an agreed-upon or widely recognized decision. I.e., If we are hungry, we go to the grocery and fulfill the Hunger-Territory, the Food-Territory, and the Consumption-Territory. At its core, a territory can be controlled, created, and removed, all at the behest of the system of organization within which it exists. For more abstract Territories, this shift and flow can be understood as the conceptual or figurative removal of a tangible item, or its literal removal. As a complex and worldly society, we must understand and accept the innate need for territories. We exist in a society with specific Areas of Concern, one of which is the concept of territories. Territories are not merely those physical bounds that we act within in our daily lives. Instead, territories are as complex as language and as simple as a single page of a book. Territories are in a constant state of flow. Ad Hoc and Post Hoc rationalizations define, control, and create these flows.
<br>
<br>
There is only one option to counter these flows. That option is (De)Territorialization. (De)Territorialization is the act of destroying, breaking, and manipulating a territory to the degree that its integral essence is no longer constituted in form, function, or symbol. After the act of (De)Territorializing comes the potential to (Re)Territorialize. (Re)Territorializing is the process of picking up the pieces left in the wake of (De)Territorialization and using them to rebuild something new. A (Re)Territorialized society is not necessarily built entirely new out of the raw materials, ideals, and philosophies born after (De)Territorializing. Instead, it is the shifting of existing resources into new forms, paths, and symbols. This means that a (Re)Territorialized society is not built on a whole new world, but rather in its appropriation of the carcass of the old world, it becomes a whole new world all its own.
<br>
<br>
A clear and succinct definition of (De/Re)Territorialization in this given context would be as follows: 
<br>
<br>
        (De)Territorialization is the deliberate breaking down or dismantling of a system, place, language, idea, item, etc, to the extent that its original structure, form, function, or symbolic presence is disrupted or fundamentally altered.
		I.e, a language is dismantled and stripped from its original context, leaving behind fragments that no longer resemble the form it once took.
        <br>
<br>
	(Re)Territorialization is the deliberate appropriation or recombination of (De)Territorialized fragments in a transformative process that establishes a new structure, form, function, or symbolic presence.
		I.e, these fragmented pieces of a language are reassembled, or appropriated in a transformative fashion that does not merely simulate the previously existing linguistic Territory.
        <br>
<br>
	Territories are those that build up the superficial and significant justifications of the ruling order/system of governance. Using the Marxist concept of base and Superstructure, we can better understand how Territories come to define, justify, and perpetuate their existence, as well as the existence/rules of the government/system within which they exist. In Marxist thought, the Base is that which creates, defines, and exerts power over society. Essentially, it is the societal kernel from which everything is born. The Superstructure is that which is supported by the base. It is the active body, element, and piece of the Base that actively sways, tempers, and flows through society. It is the Imago of the base, the final form of its metamorphosis into absolute control. Territories are the explicit pieces of the Superstructure that can be held, seen, said, or interacted with; they are not simply the tangible aspects of our lives, but are also highly intangible. They are a series of images, signs, symbols, objects, and places that can be interfaced with, interpreted, and upheld as the justification for the status quo.
<br>
<br>
In his societal analysis, 'The Society of the Spectacle,' Guy Debord places two concepts above all others within the idea of the Society of the Spectacle. These are Weltanschauung, or Worldview, and Zeitgeist, or Spirit of the Time. Worldview can be described as that which the Superstructure, Spectacle, or Territories (these are all similar but distinctly different ideas that relate and overlap one another) espouse. The Base, in turn, builds itself upon the incarnation of the Territory. Worldview is how we shape the world around us through our peripheral and central creation and dissemination of Territories. Coupled with and growing from the Worldview is the Spirit of the Time. Spirit of the Time grows from the images, words, sounds, sights, etc (think again of our definition of Territories), espoused from these Territories as they are disseminated and spread worldwide. It is the feeling or spirit evoked en masse as these Territories are internalized, actualized, and realized. Worldview and Spirit of the Time allow us, as viewer participants, to recognize the defining Territories, Actions of Territorialization, and Sustaining of Territories within our current age, past ages, and potential future ages.
<br>
<br>
<b>Section 0.3 - Our Need for Territories</b>
<br>
<br>
Now that we have established a basic understanding of Territories as an abstract concept that envelops the world and all of our actions as humans within it, we need to discuss our innate need, as social animals, for Territories.
<br>
<br>
To begin our discussion on the need for Territories, we must first look at the development of sociality in Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Through anthropological and sociological studies, there have been theories developed that state, "For 200 million years mammalian parental care imposed selective pressure on mothers to become sensitive to signals of discomfort emitted by their offspring, e.g., hunger, danger or cold (de Waal 2010, p. 67)." In addition, we can understand too that there have been transitional periods of human social development, such as, "Owing to climate change 4–5 million years ago, our ancestors had to adapt to living conditions in the grasslands (von Hippel 2018, p. 33; Furuichi 2019, p. 94; Turner 2021, p. 57), but their disposition toward "... low-density networks, low sociality, high mobility, and strong individualism" (Maryanski and Turner 1992, p. 13) was inappropriate for life in the open savannah." What does this say about the contemporary amalgamation of societal organization? We now know that in our modern state as a global society, we have developed the antithesis to this prehistoric hunter-gatherer society and live within it. With our high-density networks, high sociality, and low mobility <b>[1]</b>, we have organized ourselves across massive areas of the Earth that we now call states or Territories. However, what does this mean in the context of Territories, when a society develops a high-density network or when a network contains a high level of sociality combined with a bizarrely low level of mobility? This means that the human population has evolved into one that is highly susceptible to being drawn into or contained within Territories, and, in many ways, one could argue that we have developed a need for Territories.
<br>
<br>
We can also understand better that our need for Territories relates to the selective evolutionary pressures that have brought us to this point. If we extrapolate these pressures that initially stem from maternal care onto the entirety of the human population, we gain a new insight into ourselves and our need for Territories. When humans experience excessive cold or warmth, they instinctively seek shelter against this threat and naturally perceive it as a danger. Through societal norms and natural perception, they understand it is in their best interest to shelter against these issues. The same is true of the pain one may feel when hungry. They turn to the store, the restaurant, and the refrigerator, just as they may turn to an apartment, home, or anything else that keeps them out of the weather. On an abstracted macro level, humans turn toward Territories for care as they once turned only to their mothers for care.
<br>
<br>
For example, the Word-Territory of the book can act as a form of transportation away from the dangers, emotions, and realities that bind us to our own lived experiences, whereas before, the soothing voice of our mothers telling us a story helped to relax us. The sandwich from the deli acts as a Food-Territory and lessens our hunger; again, we must understand abstractly that this removes us from the potential dangers of starvation. Nevertheless, historically, food was not a given; through our social relations and bonds, we formed tribes and would gather collectively to maintain social cohesion. These prehistoric systems were primarily based on interpersonal connections (friendships, genealogical or romantic connections) that were then extended, allowing for the creation of more complex intra-group connections (tribes, chiefdoms, bands). These connections created relative societal norms based on the inherent needs of the group as a cohesive unit.
<br>
<br>
Everything we know and participate in is part of a larger system. One way to view this system is through the Deleuzian concept of the Rhizome. Everything connects and expands just as the rhizome of a plant does, extending without a central location but still intimately tied together in a complex and entangled way. Unlike a hierarchical structure, such as a tree, the Rhizome relies on its decentralization and the constant extension of its roots. Our social connections form a more extensive structure, indirectly relating to every other point that has contributed to creating the Territory the rhizome encompasses. Within this system are Territories, and within these Territories, there are systems; this is the social/cultural/economic/cultural Rhizome of humanity, forever decentralized and inherently non-hierarchical <b>[2]</b>. This Rhizomic system relates and connects our sociality to the larger world that we inhabit. Although our networks may only contain five people that we consider close friends, 10-15 people that we know well enough to consider trusted friends, and ~150 people that we consider likely cooperators (Dunbar 2021, p. 71), these friends or cooperators most likely have their own networks that are equal to or larger than ours. This means that our networks, when combined and united through normative relationships, can span significant distances and exist across multiple territories. 
<br>
<br>
If this is the case for contemporary human reality, then we are inherently attached to and confined to the Territories we have created. Although this may contradict the inherently decentralized nature of the Rhizome, it must be understood as not a deliberate and conscious choice, but rather a conscribed and subconscious one. We are all connected to the Rhizomic nature of history, and yet humans are entangled within the constraining forces of Territorialization. While the decentralization of the Rhizome allows for expansive connections, we remain conscribed to Territories that are beyond our control. We exist in a Territorialized world that we do not choose. We therefore must better understand why and how Territorialization—and thus (De/Re)Territorialization—is so crucial to advancing the human species, particularly regarding the expansion and refinement of socialization.
<br>
<br>

<b>Section 0.4 - A Brief History of Territories in Design</b>
<br>
<br>
Design is built on and shaped by Territories, especially when examined as a historical field of study defined by its deep intergenerational relations. Design cannot exist without Territories and the process of Territorialization and (De)Terroritorialization that continuously define and refine them. When dissecting the historical foundations of modern design as a field encompassing many diverse practices and limitless mediums, we observe a persistent relationship between design movements and the Territories they inhabit. For Design Reformers, this entailed the establishment of the Refinement-Territory, the Material-Realist-Territory, and the Taste-Making-Territory—each of which was connected to, or subordinated by, the Industrial-Territory. While it may seem excessive to classify these acts or ideals as territories all their own, it is crucial to recognize the all-encompassing nature of Territories and the process of Territorialization.
<br>
<br>
It may sound obvious to claim that "Design has always had a strong relation to the Territories it de/refines." One might respond, "Well, of course, the realm of design has always been intimately tied to any formation of territory that regards it." However, our objective here is to explicitly define these territories/acts of Territorialization so that their implicit existence can be critically examined. When we assert that Design Reformers established the Refinement-Territory, which was created by and thus subordinated to the Industrial-Territory, we are affirming that this relationship is not merely a historical curiosity—it is a defining force in the evolution of design since the 19th century. Our aim is not to treat these historical dynamics as purely existing as artifacts of the past but instead to critically analyze their role in shaping design. We must explore historic and contemporary movements using materialist and post-structuralist methodologies, actively criticizing the structures and implications they hold, not merely acting as passive observers of them.
<br>
<br>

<b>Section 0.5 - Conclusion of our Introduction</b>
<br>
<br>
Through the introductory writing regarding Reshaping Design in a Post-Image Society we have discussed the most basic interpretations and analysis of (De)/(Re)Territorialization, defined in broad and abstract terms what Territories are, examined (Post Hoc and Ad Hoc) Territorialization, (De)/(Re)Territorialization, Rhizomes, and a handful of other related concepts. We have also discussed the evolutionary need for Territories as outlined in Section 0.3, Our Need for Territories, and we very briefly introduced Territories and their purpose/relation to design in the aptly named A Brief History of Territories in Design. Now, to round out the introductory statements, we must introduce our final major definitions (which will be reintroduced and expanded upon later).
<br>
<br>
So far, we have introduced Territories broadly, but now we must put them in their rightful place. To begin this, we will reintroduce the Food-Territory, the Hunger-Territory, and the Land-Territory. These territories are all literal; they are all tangible places or things, or they are effective feelings, and they are all rooted in material needs. A human must eat (Hunger-Territory), and when they must eat, they require food (Food-Territory), and for there to be food, there first must be land that food can be produced within/on (Land-Territory). These are what we will from here on refer to as our Basic and/or Literal Territories; they are always rooted in one's material needs. Continuing from here, we move on from the literal to what we will refer to as our Affective and or Symbolic Territories. These territories, such as the Book-Territory, the Story-Territory, and the Word-Territory, are all rooted in the psychological experience that one has in this world. This refers to the way that symbols affect us in our daily lives and how intensely influential they are. To finish off, we have the Institutional and or Systemic Territories. These Territories are by far the most wide-reaching, macro-level form that Territories can exist as; they are rooted in the historical, political, and cultural structures that define our World Views and the Spirit of the Times. We have previously mentioned the Refinement-Territory, the Material-Realist-Territory, the Taste-Making-Territory, and the Industrial-Territory; these are all Institutional and or Systemic Territories because of the culturally, socially, politically, or economically defining characteristics that they are bound to and determined by.
<br>
<br>
Although these definitions are not exhaustive or tiered, they will serve as guiding principles throughout this study, ensuring a reliable methodology for identifying a Territory. In addition to these definitions of Territories it must also be understood that within these Territories there are (Sub)Territories i.e. the Food-Territory is a (Sub)Territory of the Hunger-Territory which is a (Sub)Territory of the Land-Territory (There are even more (Sub)Territories here. Still, for clarity sake we will leave it at this example of 3.) These territories, though, are not hierarchical in any way. While they may be reliant on one another, i.e., the Book-Territory relies on the Land-Territory and the Industrial-Territory, it is ultimately part of the Rhizomic structure of society at large. Therefore, it is critical to recognize that Territories are fluid, as stated in our introductory paragraph, our lives. Thus, our Territories are built and entangled within a series of flows (economic, cultural, social, political) that pass through, surround us, and are constantly outside of us just as much as they are inside of us. With our final introduction of major definitions complete, we have come to the end of our introductory section. From here, we will explore all outlined concepts of the introduction to greater degrees while also building new Rhizomic Relationships throughout, especially those that regard contemporary design movements, post-structuralist thought in the 21st century, and, of course, how we may potentially (De)/(Re)Territorialize and thus reshape design in a post-image society.

<h3>Section 1 - The Post-Image Society</h3>

<b>Section 1.1 - The Contemporary Society of Spectacular Images Embedded Like Honey In the Skulls of Lions, or <i>Fruitless Design</i></b>
<br>
<br>

	We wake up and grab our phones, a book/newspaper, or oatmilk from the fridge. Regardless of their status as class and lifestyle signifiers, what unites all of these is that they are designed objects. Some of these objects are mercilessly designed, sometimes without thought, in an impulsive and seemingly haphazard manner; other times, they are so perfectly designed that the compulsivity of the designer itself overpowers the intended use of the product. So what do these artistic decisions/drives mean, and what do they say about contemporary design thought and practice?
    <br>
<br>
	Some designs may be purposely sloppy; we can consider these designs to be driven by a certain impulsive casualness. In contrast, an equal number of designs are tailored like haute couture; we can consider these designs to be instead driven by compulsive manicuring. To some, these artistic drives could be seen as part of the ever-turning cycle of design that has existed since the mid-19th century, for example, the masterful artisan in competition with the unskilled factory worker. This analysis isn’t wrong per se. But, it can simultaneously be classified as a sort of absurd amalgamation of a cultureless and ever future-losing society, e.g., the resurgence of design practices/ideals that revolve in a cyclic nature. Again, this analysis isn’t entirely wrong, either.
    <br>
<br>
	Ultimately, although it is larger than both of these issues combined, and is also in many ways reflected in the way these issues combine and relate to one another through antagonistic and protagonistic methods, the skilled artisans push forward design (compulsive manicuring). At the same time, factory work serves capitalists' desire to repeat the design cycle (impulsive casualness). Combined, these issues form a malignant gestalt of our current zeitgeist. They act as a reflection of the post-image society of the spectacle, the imageless void filled with mirrors showing nothing, painstakingly arranged almost as if by sheer chance, to the point where the resulting lack of anything becomes astounding rather than profound. These are signs of a society that has grown so drunk on its image that it can no longer stand to walk to the bus stop and instead falls asleep in the bar booth covered in its hedonistic vomit. A society that has become so splurged out on ecstasy-inducing imagery, we crawl, more than we ever truly walk, to the next facade of culture. This is what these design ideologies and practices reveal about our society and our current territories. It is through our analysis and reflection on these issues that we can (De)Territorialize our current amalgamation of design, allowing it to be reconstructed in a meaningful and (Re)Territorializing way.
    <br>
<br>
	In our Post-Image Society, the function of design has shifted from being an integral part of a utilitarian approach to viewing the world and the way products interact with it to being a simulation of this utility. Design is now Post-Post-Modern in the sense that the literalness of an object is subjected to the imitated and simulated concept of its tangibility. In referencing the literal oats that make up oat milk cartoonishly, the designed product removes itself from the utility within the economy of images. Instead, it places itself in a purely simulated world where the economy of images becomes a literal economic force and, therefore, a tangible entity. Here we now have two new concepts: the literal-tangible1 (utility) and the simulated-tangible2 (emotional).
    <br>
<br>

The literal-tangible is: The object as it materially exists, or as it attempts to reference, in the most direct way, its material reality. This is evident in design as a realistic attempt at portraying “the thing” (e.g., a realistic depiction of an oat, either photographically or neutrally, on oat milk packaging). In Baudrillard’s terms, this is the first order of simulation: a faithful representation that acknowledges the existence of an underlying reality.
<br>
<br>
The simulated-tangible is: The simulation of the simulation of the image, which is the hyper-idealized version of the object. This is seen in design as an idealized simulation of the realistic representation of “the thing” (e.g., a cartoonish or idealized depiction of an oat; its literal style of being a recognizable object remains the same, but its symbolic style differs and is a simulation of the real). In Baudrillard’s terms, this is the third-order of simulation: a simulated representation of the simulacrum, which is a simulation of the first-order representation.
<br>
<br>
	The literal-tangible instead becomes subject to the simulated-tangible, therefore, insofar as the object itself can be understood to be constituted by what it displays as being made in its image (literal-tangible), it can also be understood to be made in the image of the simulated conception of itself (simulated-tangible). In this simulation, the object takes on its hyper-idealized form in the consumer's mind.
    <br>
<br>
In short, what we’re saying is that design acts not only as a territory in itself but also as a potent territorializing agent that has the potential to change the lives of millions of consumers. When we refer to consumers here, it is essential to clarify that we do not mean the act of being a person who buys an item; instead, we are referring to the broader definition of the term. In the modern world, consumers are constantly bombarded with content, whether it be images of trendy items in ads encountered while walking through an “up and coming” neighborhood, the barrage of these same ads on social media platforms, or the mindless scrolling that is expected on these platforms. These acts of consumption are, for many, conspicuous; they reflect what the consumer sees in others onto themselves. It can then be argued that consumption, and consumption alone, is the primary driver of social territorialization, or put simply, socialization, for many people.
<br>
<br>
As social animals, human beings cannot exist without these potent territorializing forces that surround and permeate us. As established previously, we know that humanity cannot exist without territories. Without territories, we are disorganized, incompetent, and generally lost. At times, some people may be pushed to extremes and choose to exist outside the prescribed territories that most of humanity participates in. But more generally, we accept the fact that territories, as a macro concept, provide us with everything that we need—food, clothing, and entertainment — can all be found in readily available amounts.
<br>
<br>
Existing within a hyper-capitalistic society, we are left with the sheer insignificance of choice, as under our current social configuration, choice is essentially an illusion driven by economic, political, and social forces that exist globally. Therefore, our choices become increasingly meaningless when we recognize the constant bombardment of information we are forced to view every day of our lives. Is the choice ever even ours? Are we conscious and willing in our choice? If consent can be manufactured for major contemporary events such as the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Vietnam, etc.. with a little bit of feigning ignorance, devils advocacy, and elbow grease, then it is imperative to see that it can also be manufactured effortlessly, with little to no required input at this point, to sell you something that you do not need, but can relate to, or even better are told that you relate to. This manufacturing of consent is the core ethos of the Post-Image Society; it is the honey in the lion's skull. When viewed in macro, it is entirely absurd! But shift the viewpoint to the micro, and you will see the bees living splendid lives within the rotting corpse of a once great predator. There is no fruit to entice the bees, no pollen or reward. There is no future. This is Fruitless Design.
<br>
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;1. This can be defined simply as the cohesion of design ideology and object utility. When the design of the object matches its utility, you have a literal tangibility that can be understood without question. For example, the eyeglasses repair kit is designed with pure utility in mind; its ideological execution, or its design, matches its literal use.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. If the literal-tangible, sitting on one end of a spectrum, is the cohesion of design ideology and object utility, then simulated-tangibility is the complete and total lack of cohesion between design and utility. The tangibility of the object becomes simulated, and thus it relies on orders of simulation to retain its relevance. For example, Graza’s branding relates to and appeals to the prescribed emotions of the end-user experience (cutesy and rustic); in doing so, the product’s utility is usurped by the design, thus creating tension rather than cohesion. Literal-Tangibility and Simulated-Tangibility sit on opposite sides of a spectrum; in between, there are many different points at which an object can rest.
