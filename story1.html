    <h2>It Crawled Towards Me, It Called to Me, It Became Me</h2>
    <h3>by Blossom Marquez</h3>
   <p> It was the night of May 23rd, 2025. I had stepped outside of my apartment to smoke a cigarette, one that I hoped would be the last. I walked around the block, the black of night drowned out by LED bulbs flashing thousands of times a second to remind me that life never stops. It just keeps going, you can shut it off, but it keeps going. As I walked the presence of a stranger besides me, in front of me, and behind me alerted me. Overwhelmed with the feeling of a presence I stopped myself, checked, saw nothing, but still felt it. Lingering. It was lingering.
<br><br>
This presence, this pull, dragged me through the streets. As it propelled me through the winding grid of streets I could feel that there was something else crawling towards me. Not something in the drowned dark, or something making its way through the grid of streets, not through the blinking bulbs that reminded me on every street of my impermanence. Really I couldn’t even tell that it was crawling, maybe I could, but I really couldn’t. But it was, regardless of me. I kept walking, the air was milky, that is to say it was thick and prosperous, the late spring rains combining with the early summer heat. A thick milky haze, conceived on this night just for me, I think. Adding to this all was the lingering smell of my cigarette smoke. An almost putrid scent, a dead body in wait.
<br><br>
The presence I had felt before was still lingering, floating around my head in every direction. I had walked five, maybe six blocks at this point. I wasn’t entirely sure which way I was walking but I was pretty sure it was North, I had crossed Church Ave at some point, my home being on Cortelyou. This crawling figure still lay somewhere out there. A relic waiting to be uncovered, discovered, cherished, placed where it should be. It was singing a tune, a soft hum droning at 52Hz, a siren song. Calling to those that are willing to hear. The rhythm of cars bumping down Flatbush Ave sung out in unison, a calypso so alluring that it was near impossible to drown if out with any other stimuli.
<br><br>
Gradually the scenery shifted from the frenetic dances on Flatbush and died down into the calm oceanic waves of the conjoining waters of Parkside and Ocean Aves. A baby in a basket floating down these territorial waters I was. Lulled away from my home by the figural songs shaping a destiny I couldn’t recognize yet. A new being born from the thick milky haze lit up by a million blinking LEDs in the tight grids of South Brooklyn. I was see through. A little see through baby floating away, a star in a milky haze.
<br><br>
I had arrived, set down my feet, planted them, and become me. The crawling figure stretched out lazily before me, its hills, benches, lakes, birds, squirrels, rats, trashcans, memorials all buzzing in perfect unison. A sonata in 52Hz. It had become me, and I it. The Amazon and Rio Negro confluence sluiced over me. My pallid skin covered in the sandy loam, I sunk into the bottom. The smell of the cigarette had gone, the LEDs blinking ceased, and the grid acquiesced into the soft boundaries of cast into the iron fences bordering my new life, my new self. It crawled towards me, it called to me, it became me.
