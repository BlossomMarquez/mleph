        My little enchanted parkside home is an ongoing public digital art
        project. It is an exploration of the concept of public space,
        particularly within a smooth city. When we are allowed to interact,
        shape, and be shaped by the public spaces that inhabit the same city
        that we do, what becomes of us and these public spaces? It is, in many
        ways, a becoming, a constantly shifting and growing rhizomatic
        relationship that exists only as much as we allow it to. The smooth
        city, as defined by René Boer, is the city as product. A space where
        there are no abnormalities, the workers that sustain the space are never
        seen, graffiti is non-existent, and all inhabitants look as if they
        “belong” there. The urban environment becomes a curated set-piece for
        the well-off and wealthy. In Williamsburg, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights,
        and many other New York neighborhoods, minorities have been pushed out
        and replaced with well-off, and often white, inhabitants. The former
        characteristics of these neighborhoods are sanitized, and the streets,
        sidewalks, and parks are clean. Boutique stores pop up, and the same
        goes for higher-end fashion or tech companies opening flagship stores;
        see the Google, Apple, and Carhartt stores in Williamsburg as a prime
        example of this phenomenon. These “undesirable” neighborhoods have
        become up-and-coming neighborhoods, and in their final phase feel like
        extensions of Manhattan into the outer boroughs. This is the result of
        the smooth city; the apartment facades hold the spying eyes of security
        cameras, public spaces are turned private (Domino Park), and the general
        inhabitants become “clean” and “proper”; any porous characteristics have
        been wiped clean, turned smooth.
